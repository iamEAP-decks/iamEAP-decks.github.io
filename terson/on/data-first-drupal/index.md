<p class="message">
  A conversation targeted for Drupal core developers and the wider Drupal community about where to take analytics in Drupal and its ecosystem.
</p>

## Overview

One of the strengths of Drupal is that it's so easy to be the integration point--the glue--between other purpose-built, best-of-breed technologies. Analytics platforms are no different.

As we look to the future of Drupal, and keeping mind how saturated the web analytics market is, now seems like a good time to ask, "Should we remove analytics capabilities from core in favor of integration with third-party vendors? Or should we keep analytics close or even expand our capabilities?"

This talk covers, roughly, the following:

* An overview of Core Statistics in 7.x and 8.x, and problems therein that contrib has tried to solve
* An introduction to the concept of "integrated analytics" and how it fits in with the "web experience management" vision of Drupal
* A proposed roadmap and vision for a minimum viable product in Drupal 9
